To install any Sublime package you need to install Package Installer. For installing go to Tools ->Install Package Control and click on it and it will be installed automatically. When you are done with installing package control again go to Tools-> command palette and search for Install Package.
When you click on Install Package you will see some processing at bottom of your Sublime window and a search popup will be opened.

You can search for any Sublime plugin here. Search for “Emmet” and click on it to install it.
